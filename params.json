{"name":"Taskwarrior-web","body":"# A Web Interface for Taskwarrior\r\n\r\nA lightweight, Sinatra-based web interface for the\r\nwonderful [Taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/) todo application.\r\n\r\n**Now compatible with ALL versions of Taskwarrior, including the new 2.0.0**\r\n\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web.png)](http://travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web)\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`gem install taskwarrior-web`\r\n\r\nThis will install an executable called `task-web`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`task-web` at your terminal to start it up. This will start the process,\r\nbackground it, and open the URL in your browser.\r\n\r\nIt uses [Vegas](https://github.com/quirkey/vegas/) to make the Sinatra app into\r\nan executable, so all options for Vegas are valid for `task-web`. Type\r\n`task-web -h` for more options.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThe current featureset includes:\r\n\r\n* Viewing tasks (duh) sorted and grouped in various ways.\r\n* Creating a new task with a due date, project, and tags.\r\n* `task-web` will pull your `task` config (from `.taskrc`) and use it to\r\n  determine date formatting and when an upcoming task should be marked as\r\n  \"due\".\r\n* If you are on a Mac and use Fluid.app, you get a dock badge showing the\r\n  number of pending tasks.\r\n\r\n## Known Issues\r\n\r\n* taskwarrior-web requires Ruby >= 1.9. It will not work with 1.8 and lower.\r\n  Support for 1.8 will happen at some point.\r\n\r\n## Marginalia\r\n\r\nThis project is not developed by the Taskwarrior team. Obviously,\r\ntaskwarrior-web extends Taskwarrior, but the projects are separate.","tagline":"A Sinatra-based web interface for the Taskwarrior todo application.
