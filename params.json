Because being a neck-beard is only fun sometimes.","body":"# A Web Interface for Taskwarrior\r\n\r\nA lightweight, Sinatra-based web interface for the\r\nwonderful [Taskwarrior](http://taskwarrior.org/) todo application.\r\n\r\n![TaskwarriorWeb screenshot](https://dl.dropbox.com/u/107599300/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n[![Gem Version](https://badge.fury.io/rb/taskwarrior-web.png)](http://badge.fury.io/rb/taskwarrior-web)\r\n[![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web.png)](http://travis-ci.org/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web)\r\n\r\n## Requirements\r\n\r\n* `ruby` >= 1.9 (support for `ruby` < 1.9 is very unlikely, but pull requests\r\n  are gladly accepted).\r\n\r\n## Installation\r\n\r\n`gem install taskwarrior-web`\r\n\r\nThis will install an executable called `task-web`\r\n\r\n## Usage\r\n\r\n`task-web` at your terminal to start it up. This will start the process,\r\nbackground it, and open the URL in your browser.\r\n\r\nIt uses [Vegas](https://github.com/quirkey/vegas/) to make the Sinatra app into\r\nan executable, so all options for Vegas are valid for `task-web`. Type\r\n`task-web -h` for more options.\r\n\r\n## Features\r\n\r\nThe current featureset includes:\r\n\r\n* Viewing tasks sorted and grouped in various ways.\r\n* Creating a new task with a due date, project, and tags.\r\n* Editing and deleting tasks (only task >= 2.0).\r\n* `task-web` will pull your `task` config (from `.taskrc`) and use it to\r\n  determine date formatting and when an upcoming task should be marked as\r\n  \"due\".\r\n* If you are on a Mac and use Fluid.app, you get a dock badge showing the\r\n  number of pending tasks.\r\n* [Optional HTTP Basic authentication][1].\r\n\r\n[1]: https://github.com/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web/wiki/Additional-.taskrc-options\r\n\r\n## Reporting Bugs\r\n\r\nTo report a bug, use the [Github issue tracker][2]. Since `taskwarrior-web`\r\nworks with several different versions of `task`, using many different\r\nconfigurations, please include the output from `task _version` and either the\r\noutput of `task show` or a copy of your `.taskrc` file when filing a bug. This helps me reproduce bugs easier.\r\n\r\nHere is an example of a [good bug report][3].\r\n\r\n[2]: http://github.com/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web/issues\r\n[3]: http://github.com/theunraveler/taskwarrior-web/issues/26\r\n\r\n## Marginalia\r\n\r\n* This project is not developed by the Taskwarrior team. Obviously, taskwarrior-web extends Taskwarrior, but the projects are separate.\r\n* `task-web` is mostly designed to run locally. As such, security is not of the highest priority. You may find that things such as CSRF protection are lacking. If things like this are important to you, please file an issue or a pull request.\r\n","google":""}
